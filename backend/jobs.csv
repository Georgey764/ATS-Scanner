As part of the broader Neuron organization, our team works across multiple technology layers \\- from frameworks and kernels and collaborate with compiler to runtime and collectives. We not only optimize current performance but also contribute to future architecture designs, working closely with customers to enable their models and ensure optimal performance. This role offers a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of machine learning, high\\-performance computing, and distributed architectures, where you'll help shape the future of AI acceleration technology  

  

You will architect and implement business critical features, and mentor a brilliant team of experienced engineers. We operate in spaces that are very large, yet our teams remain small and agile. There is no blueprint. We're inventing. We're experimenting. It is a very unique learning culture. The team works closely with customers on their model enablement, providing direct support and optimization expertise to ensure their machine learning workloads achieve optimal performance on AWS ML accelerators. The team collaborates with open source ecosystems to provide seamless integration and bring peak performance at scale for customers and developers.  

  

This role is responsible for development, enablement and performance tuning of a wide variety of LLM model families, including massive scale large language models like the Llama family, DeepSeek and beyond. The Inference Enablement and Acceleration team works side by side with compiler engineers and runtime engineers to create, build and tune distributed inference solutions with Trainium and Inferentia. Experience optimizing inference performance for both latency and throughput on such large models across the stack from system level optimizations through to Pytorch or JAX is a must have.

At AWS AI our vision is to make deep learning pervasive for everyday developers and to democratize access to cutting edge infrastructure. In order to deliver on that vision, we’ve created innovative software and hardware solutions that make it possible.  

  

AWS Neuron SDK is the complete software stack for the AWS Inferentia and Trainium machine learning accelerators designed by Annapurna Labs inside AWS. The Neuron SDK consists of a compiler, runtime, frameworks, and tooling customers need. It’s also preinstalled in AWS Deep Learning AMIs and Deep Learning Containers for customers to quickly get started with running high performance and cost\\-effective inference and training.  

  

This position is for a Software Engineer for the AWS Neuron SDK team with a deep background in Linux and device drivers. Deep knowledge and experience with hardware\\-based accelerator platforms (such as encryption, TCP offload, storage accelerators and router/switch platforms) and the necessary complexity for the software layers that interact and manage them. Experience implementing high performance software drivers, needed to ensure high throughput from software to hardware, is also a necessity. This engineer will work with the team to define the key interfaces and will develop the runtime stack and driver that manages the accelerator.  

  

This is a fast\\-paced, intellectually challenging position, where you’ll work with thought\\-leaders in multiple technology areas. You’ll have high standards for yourself and everyone you work with, and you’ll be constantly looking for ways to improve our products' performance, quality and cost.  

  

We’re changing an industry, and we want individuals who are ready for this challenge and want to reach beyond what is possible today.
